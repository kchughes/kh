  <h3> A little about me </h3>			
    <p> I am a Los Angeles native, current Chicago resident (okay, the suburbs, but it still counts!) pursuing a Master's in Technical 
Communication and Information Design at Illinois Institute of Technology. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that information should be accessible and easy to digest, no matter what the format. I apply
this philosophy to everything I do. Creative problem-solving is one of my strengths, especially when the problem may be vocalized as 
as simple as "This doesn't sound/look right" or "I'm not sure what's wrong." </p>

<p> Goal-oriented and problem solving approach to design and content. Internal communication and external.
I work very well collaboratively and 
I've worked in business education for almost seven years, so I know what 
Take information, data, images, and almost any kind of content you can think of, and transform it into something that 
is just as easy to use, and look at as it is to understand.

<p>I've  worked on many types of projects, either design, content, or a combination of the two (or both). 
Here is a sampling of the types of projects I've done: 
<ul>
<li>Holiday cards <span class="digital"> digital </span>)</li>
<li>Invitations <span class="digital">digital</span> <span class="print">print</span></li>
<li>PowerPoint presentation templates <span class="digital">digital</span></li>

<p>I've been described as observant, analytical, creative, adaptable, and thorough. I am a problem solver, team-player, 
planner, organizer, and communicator,
</ul>

</p>
<p>I am currently </p>
<p>I am fluent in Spanish, proficient in French, and am learning Chinese and Japanese. When I'm not creating beautiful
content and design for other people, I am reading, writing, or going on city hikes.
